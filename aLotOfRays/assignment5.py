# Part 1
# Write a function that takes an array as a parameter and returns a reveresed, sorted copy of that array. Check 
# to see if the array is empty, if it is, display that message. You decide the size of the array, but it should be
# created with input from the user
# Example:
# Input - [5, 3, 7, 2, 4, 8]
# Output - [8, 7, 5, 4, 3, 2]
# 
# Part 2
# Get the min, max, sum, and average of an array of integers. You decide the size of the array, but it should be
# created with input from the user
# Example:
# Input - [4, 7, 2, 1, 6]
# Output:
# Min - 1
# Max - 7
# Sum - 20
# Average - 4
#
# Part 3
# Write a function that takes two arrays as parameters and will return True if there is a common element between them. 
# You decide the size of the array, but it should be created with input from the user
# Example:
# Array1 - [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9]
# Array2 - [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
# Output: There is a shared element
#
# Array1 - [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
# Array2 - [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
# Output: There is not a shared element

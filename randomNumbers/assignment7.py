# Part 1
# Generate a series of random numbers between 1 and 100 and put them in an array, then sort the array. Print both of them
# Example Output:
# Unsorted Array - [18, 97, 43, 1, 37, 88, 77, 57, 79, 48]
# Sorted Array - [1, 18, 37, 43, 48, 57, 77, 79, 88, 97
#
# Part 2
# Generate a random number between 1 and 100 and store it. Then have the user try to guess the number and give hints if the number is lower or higher. 
# Once the user gets it, ask them if they would like to play again. Hint: functions will help 
# Extra credit: Give the user a limited number of tries to get the number, then reveal the number once they run out of guesses

# Example Output:
# The computer has a number. What do you think it is? 57
# The number is higher. What's your guess? 93
# The number is lower. What's your guess? 80
# ...
# The number is lower. What's your guess? 60
# Correct! Would you like to play again? No
# Thank you

# Part 1
# Generate a series of random numbers between 1 and 100 and put them in an array, then sort the array. Print both of them
# Example Output:
# Unsorted Array - [18, 97, 43, 1, 37, 88, 77, 57, 79, 48]
# Sorted Array - [1, 37, 43]
array = [18, 97, 43, 1, 37, 88, 77, 57, 79, 48]
array.sort()
print(array)
